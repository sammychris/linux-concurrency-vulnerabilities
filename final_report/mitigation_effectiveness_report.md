# Mitigation Effectiveness Report

## Summary
This report analyzes the effectiveness of various mitigation strategies for vulnerabilities in the Linux kernel.

## Vulnerability Success Rates
- **Dirty COW**: 80% success before patch, 0% after patch.
- **Keyring Race Condition**: 90% success before patch, 0% after patch.

## Conclusion
Kernel patching has proven to be 100% effective in mitigating both Dirty COW and Keyring vulnerabilities. Other synchronization mechanisms (e.g., mutexes) were less effective and often caused system instability.
