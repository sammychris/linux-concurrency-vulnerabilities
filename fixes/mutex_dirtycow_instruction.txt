# Mitigating DirtyCow.

## Mutex Implementation for DirtyCow (CVE-2016-5195) Module approach

1. Run the make command
$ make

5.	Let load our kernel module using the following command
$ sudo insmod dirtycow_mitigation.ko

6.	Verify the kernel module to see if it was successfully loaded.
$ lsmod | grep dirtycow_mitigation

7.	Finally, We will test our kernel module by running the dirtycow exploit again to see if it was mitigated as expected.

8.	This final step, remove the kernel module after it has been successfully test using the follow command.
$ sudo rmmod dirtycow_mitigation
