# Vulnerability Discovery

## Race Conditions

Race conditions arise when multiple threads access shared resources without proper synchronization, leading to unpredictable outcomes. These conditions are particularly dangerous in system kernels, where attackers can exploit unsynchronized resource access to gain unauthorized privileges or disrupt services.

### Key Vulnerabilities:

1. **CVE-2016-5195 (Dirty COW)**
   - **Description**: This vulnerability allows attackers to write to read-only memory through a race condition in the Linux kernel's memory management, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
   - **Impact**: Enables attackers to overwrite sensitive files like `/etc/passwd`, gaining unauthorized access.
   - **Mitigation**: Applying kernel patches and employing synchronization techniques like mutexes, though kernel patches proved most effective.

2. **CVE-2015-1325 (Keyring Race Condition)**
   - **Description**: A TOCTTOU (Time-of-Check to Time-of-Use) vulnerability in Linux's keyring facility. Attackers can exploit the race condition between the keyring check and usage to escalate privileges.
   - **Impact**: Allows attackers to manipulate keyring objects, leading to unauthorized access to system resources.
   - **Mitigation**: Applying kernel patches or using synchronization mechanisms like mutexes or spinlocks. Kernel updates were found to be the most reliable.

3. **TOCTTOU Vulnerabilities**
   - **Description**: These vulnerabilities occur when the system checks a condition (e.g., file existence) but the state changes before the operation is performed, allowing attackers to manipulate the system.
   - **Example**: CVE-2015-1325, where an attacker races to manipulate the keyring object between the check and use phases.
   - **Impact**: Privilege escalation and data tampering.
   - **Mitigation**: Synchronization techniques or reducing the window between check and use operations.

4. **Deadlock Bugs**
   - **Description**: Deadlocks occur when two or more processes block each other while waiting for shared resources, causing the system to freeze. In some cases, this can be exploited to launch Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.
   - **Example**: Kernel-level deadlocks caused by incorrect ordering in resource allocation, leading to system-wide freezes.
   - **Mitigation**: Lock hierarchy or timeout mechanisms to prevent deadlocks, as well as deadlock detection algorithms.
